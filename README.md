## Getting Started  

- [x] **Installing Genymotion Emulator (Genymotion Guide)**  

- [x] **Architecture of Mobile Apps (Concept Slides)**  

**There are two categories of mobile apps:**  
1. View heavy data driven  
ex. email, social, news, Todo  
2. Graphics heavy drawing  
ex. games and photo editing  

**Screen Archetypes are:**  
1. Login
2. Register
3. Stream
4. Detail
5. Creation
6. Profile
7. Settings
8. Maps

**Learning to build real data-driven apps requires a few core concepts:**  
1. Views: Common controls and view layout
2. Events: Interaction and event handling
3. Navigation: Screen flows and navigation
4. Data: Models, networking and persistence
5. Platform: OS services, hardware and sensors

Real data-driven apps usually require an API.  
Most mobile apps rely on server-side APIs for data.

**Models reflect the server state for the data retrieved via APIs:**  
1. Model definitions (properties, relationships)
2. JSON/XML serialization/deserialization
3. Persistence storage (database)
4. Data formatters

**Networking on mobile means interacting with a server in one of the following ways:**  
1. Interacting with models via a REST API
2. Displaying external images in the view
3. Audio/Video playback
4. Socket programming

> Mobile apps conisit of MVC + Networking + Hardware  


- [x] **Mobile Screen Archetypes**  
In mobile application development, mobile apps tend to adhere to a set of standard screen "archetypes" that appear again and again. There are over a dozen screen archetypes but there are six core archetypes that appear in nearly every app:

1. Login/Register - User signs up or logs intro their account
2. Stream - User can scroll through resources in a list
3. Details - User can view the specifics of particular resource
4. Creation - User can create new resource
5. Profile - User can view their identity and stats
6. Settings - User can configure app options
7. Splash Pages - Displayed when the app is loading
8. Onboarding - First time user visual tutorial for how the app works
9. Map View - Visualizing location based information
10. Messaging - Real time chat conversation
11. Calendar - visualize dates or events into calendar form
12. Media Players - Allowing the control of media playback
