## Getting Started  

- [x] **Installing Genymotion Emulator**  

- [x] **Architecture of Mobile Apps**  

    **There are two categories of mobile apps**  
    1. **View heavy data driven**  
        ex. email, social, news, Todo  
    2. **Graphics heavy drawing**  
        ex. games and photo editing  

    **Screen Archetypes are**  
    1. Login
    2. Register
    3. Stream
    4. Detail
    5. Creation
    6. Profile
    7. Settings
    8. Maps

    **Learning to build real data-driven apps requires a few core concepts**  
    1. **Views:** Common controls and view layout
    2. **Events:** Interaction and event handling
    3. **Navigation:** Screen flows and navigation
    4. **Data:** Models, networking and persistence
    5. **Platform:** OS services, hardware and sensors

    >Real data-driven apps usually require an API.  
    >Most mobile apps rely on server-side APIs for data.  

    ![alt text](https://github.com/xMansour/Android-CodePath-Tutorials/blob/master/Images/Getting%20Started/app%20api%20arch.png "Mobile API Architecture")

    **Models reflect the server state for the data retrieved via APIs**  
    1. Model definitions (properties, relationships)
    2. JSON/XML serialization/deserialization
    3. Persistence storage (database)
    4. Data formatters

    **Networking on mobile means interacting with a server in one of the following ways**  
    1. Interacting with models via a REST API  
    2. Displaying external images in the view  
    3. Audio/Video playback  
    4. Socket programming  


    >Mobile apps conisit of MVC + Networking + Hardware  


- [x] **Mobile Screen Archetypes**  
    In mobile application development, mobile apps tend to adhere to a set of standard screen "archetypes" that appear again and again. There are over a dozen screen archetypes but there are six core archetypes that appear in nearly every app:

    1. **Login/Register** - User signs up or logs intro their account
    2. **Stream** - User can scroll through resources in a list
    3. **Details** - User can view the specifics of particular resource
    4. **Creation** - User can create new resource
    5. **Profile** - User can view their identity and stats
    6. **Settings** - User can configure app options
    7. **Splash Pages** - Displayed when the app is loading
    8. **Onboarding** - First time user visual tutorial for how the app works
    9. **Map View** - Visualizing location based information
    10. **Messaging** - Real time chat conversation
    11. **Calendar** - visualize dates or events into calendar form
    12. **Media Players** - Allowing the control of media playback  

- [ ] **Effective Java for Android**

- [x] **Debugging Exceptions within your App**  
    The following high-level principles should be applied when faced with an unexpected app behavior during investigation:

    1. **Replicate**. Convince yourself that there is an issue in the code that can be repeatedly reproduced by following the same steps. Before assuming the code is broken, try restarting the emulator, trying the app on a device and/or fully re-building the app.  
    2. **Reduce**. Try to isolate or reduce the code surrounding the issue and figure out the simplest way to reproduce whatâ€™s occurring. Comment out or remove extraneous code that could be complicating the issue.  
    3. **Research**. If you are running into a major unexpected issue, you are probably not alone. Search Google for the behavior using any descriptive identifiers. Visit the issue tracker for the component you are seeing issues with. Search stackoverflow for posts about the same issue.  


    **Debugging Procedure**
    1. Find the final exception stack trace within the Android Monitor (logcat)
    2. Identify the exception type, message, and file with line number
    3. Open the file within your app and find the line number
    3. Look at the exception type and message to diagnose the problem
    4. If the problem is not familiar, google around searching for answers
    5. Make fixes based on the proposed solutions and re-run the app
    6. Repeat until the crash no longer occurs

    **Investigation Methodologies**
    1. Toasts
    2. Logging
    3. Breakpoints


- [x] **Beginning Android Resources**  
    1. **Exceptions**  
        **Flow of code execution**  
        1. **Normal main sequential code execution**, the program doing what it meant to accomplish.  
        2. **Execption handling code execution**, he main program flow was interrupted by an error or some other condition that prevent the continuation of the normal main sequential code execution.  

        **Exception Object**  
        This is the object that is "thrown" as a parameter from the error, and passed to the catch block. Exception object encapsulates the information about the error's location and its nature. All Exception objects must be inherited from the java.lang.Throwable.

    2. **Threads**  
    A thread is the smallest unit of processing that can be scheduled by an operating system. Therefore, using threads, a programmer can effectively create two or more tasks, that run at the same time.  

        **Runnable**
        A Runnable process block is a simple class that implements a run() method. Within the run() method is the actual task that needs to be executed by a running thread. By implementing a class with the Runnable interface, we ensure that the class holds a run() method.  

        ```java
        public class RunnableProcess implements Runnable {
        ...
        public void run() {
            ...
        }
        }
        ```

        **Creating a thread**  
        
        ```java
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new RunnableProcess(...));
        ```

        **Starting a thread**

        ```java
        thread1.start();
        ```

        **Manipulating threads**
        
        ```java
        Thread.currentThread()              //returns the currently executing thread

        Thread.sleep(long millis)           //halts the exeuction of the current thread for the given amount of time

        Thread.yield()                      //pauses the execution of the current thread to allow other threads to execute
        ```

        **Synchronization**  
        Synchronization is used when a thread is using a resource, others should wait until the resource has been released.  

        To do so, we use the keyword `synchronized` before the block of code we need the access to it to be synchronized.  

    3. **Interfaces**  
    An interface is an abstraction of class with no implementation details. **You cannot instantiate an interface**. **An interface is not a class** but it is written the same way. The first difference is that you do not use the `class` keyword but the `interface` keyword to define it. Then, there are fields and methods you cannot define here.  

        A field must be a constant: always `public`, `static` and `final`.  

        A method must be `public` and `abstract`.  

        Constructors are forbidden.  

        ```java
        public interface SimpleInterface {
            public static final int CONSTANT1 = 1;
            public abstract method1(String parameter);
        }
        ```  

        An interface can extend several interfaces, similar to the way that a class can extend another class, using the `extends` keyword.  

## Structure  
- [x] Using Context  
    A context provide access to information about the application state. It provides Activities, Fragments and Services access to resource files, images and extrnal directory locations. It also enables access to Android's built-in services such as those used for layout inflation, keyboard and finding content providers.  

    In many cases when the "context is required", we simply need to pass in the instance of the current activity. In situations where we are inside objects created by the activity such as adapters or fragments, we need to pass in the activity instance into those objects. In situations where we are outside of an activity (in an application or service), we can use the "application" context instead.  

    **Context Usage**
    1. **Explicitly starting a component**  

        ```java
        Intent intent = new Intent(context, MyActivity.class);
        startActivity(intent);
        ```

        When starting a component two pieces of information are required:
        1. **package name**, which identifies the application that contains the component.
        2. **fully qualified java class name** for the component.

        if we are starting an internal component the context could be passed since we could get the package name by `context.getPackageName()`.

    2. **Creating a view**  
        Contexts contains the following information that views require
        1. device screen size and dimensions for converting dp,sp to pixels  
        2. styled attributes
        3. activity reference for onClick attributes  

    3. **Inflating an  XML layout file**  
        We use the context to fetch the `LayoutInflater` in order to inflate an XML layout into memory  
        

    4. **Sending a local broadcast**  
        We use the context to fetch the `LocalBroadcastManager` when sending out or registering a receiver for a broadcast  

    5. **Retrieving a System Service**  
        To send notifications from an application, the NotificationManager system service is required.  

        [list](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#getSystemService(java.lang.String)) of all the available system services that can be retrieved through a context.  

    6. **Application vs Activity context**  
        There is an **Application** Context and an **Activity** Context, which last for the duration of their respective lifecycle. Most Views should be passed an Activity Context in order to gain access to what themes, styles, dimensions should be applied. If no theme is specified explicitly for the Activity, the default is to use the one specified for the application.  

        In most cases, you should use the Activity Context. Normally, the keyword `this` in Java references the instance of the class and can be used whenever Context is needed inside an Activity.  

    7. **Anonymous functions**  
        When using anonymous functions when implementing listeners, the keyword `this` in Java applies to the most immediate class being declared. In these cases, the outer class `MainActivity` has to be specified to refer to the Activity instance.  

        ```java
        public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

        @Override
        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {

            TextView tvTest = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.abc);
            tvTest.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
                @Override
                public void onClick(View view) {
                    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "hello", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                }
            });
            }
        }
        }
        ```

    8. **Adapters**
        1. Array Adapter  
        2. RecyclerView Adapter  

    **Avoiding memory leaks**  
    The Application Context is typically used when singleton instances need to be created, such as a custom manager class that requires Context information to gain access to system services but gets reused across multiple Activities. Since retaining a reference to the Activity context would cause memory not to be reclaimed after it is no longer running, it's important to use the Application Context instead.  

    To avoid memory leaks, never hold a reference to a context beyond its lifecycle. Check any of your background threads, pending handlers, or inner classes that may be holding onto context objects as well.  

    Use the application context when a context reference is needed beyond the lifespan of a component, or if it should be independent of the lifecycle of the context being passed in.  

- [x] **Android Directory Structure**  
    1. `src` - Java source files associated with your project. This includes the Activity "controller" files as well as your models and helpers.  
    2. `res` - Resource files associated with your project. All graphics, strings, layouts, and other resource files are stored in the resource file hierarchy under the res directory.  
    3. `res/layout` - XML layout files that describe the views and layouts for each activity and for partial views such as list items.  
    4. `res/values` - XML files which store various attribute values. These include strings.xml, dimens.xml, styles.xml, colors.xml, themes.xml, and so on.  
    5. `res/drawable` - Here we store the various density-independent graphic assets used in our application.  
    6. `res/drwable-hdpi` - Series of folders for density specific images to use for various resolutions.  
    7. `res/mipmap` - most commonly used for application icons.  
    8. `assets` - Uncompiled source files associated with your project; Rarely used.  
    9. `libs` - Before the introduction of Gradle build system, this directory was used for any secondary libraries (jars) you might want to link to your app.  

- [x] **Organizing your Source Files**  
    Android applications should always be neatly organized with a clear folder structure that makes your code easy to read. In addition, proper naming conventions for code and classes are important to ensure your code is clean and maintainable.  

    **Android Folder Structure**  
    
    **Organize packages by category**  
        `com.example.myapp.activities` - contains all activities.  
        `com.example.myapp.adapters` - contains all custom adapters.  
        `com.example.myapp.models` - contains all our data models.  
        `com.example.myapp.network` - contains all networking code.  
        `com.example.myapp.fragments` - contains all fragments.  
        `com.example.myapp.utils` - contains all helper supporting code.  
        `com.example.myapp.interfaces` contains all interfaces.  

- [x] **Architecture of Android Apps**  
    When first building Android apps, many developers might start by relying on Model View Controller (MVC) patterns and usually end up writing most of the core business logic in activities or fragments. The challenge is that writing tests that can validate the app's behavior is difficult to do because the code is often so closely tied to the Android framework and the various lifecycle events.  

    **Architectural Patterns**  
    1. **Standard Android**  
        `MVC` Model-View-Controller, the default approach with layout files. Activities and Fragments acting as the controller and models used for data and persistence. MVC allows the activities to process the data and update the views, so they act as a controller with some extra responsibilites that should be part of the view. Thus Activities and Fragments can become very large and very difficult to test.  

    2. **Clean Architecture**  
        `MVP` Model-View-Presenter allows Activities and Fragments to become part of the view layer and delegate most of the work to presenter objects. Each activity has a matching presenter that handles all the access to the model. The presenters also notify the Activities when the data is ready to display.  

    3. **Data-binding MVVM**  
        `MVVM` Model-View-ViewModel retrieve data from the model when requested from the view via the Android data binding framework. With this pattern, Activities and Fragments become very lightweight. Moreover, writing unit tests becomes easier because the ViewModels are decoupled from the view.  

    **Clean Architecture**  
    separates the architecture of app into three major layers:  
    1. **Presentation Layer**: how the app shows the data to the user, the presentation layer sits as the outermost layer.  
    2. **Domain**: what are the core functions of the app, the domain layer sits in the middle layer.  
    3. **Data Layer**: how the data can be accessed. the data layer resides in the inner layer.  

    **MVP**  
    The Model-View-Presenter architecture comprises:  
    1. **Model**: the data layer.  
    2. **View**: the UI layer, displays the data received from Presenter, reacts to the user input. Activities, Fragments and android.view.View are treated as View in the MVP.  
    3. **Presenter**: responds to the actions performed on the UI layer, performs actions on the Model objects and passes the results back to the Views.  

    >What we want to achieve by using MVP are simpler tasks, smaller objects, and fewer dependencies between Model and Views layers. This, in turns makes our code easier to manage and test.  

    **Differences from MVC**
    1. View is more separated from Model. The Presenter is a mediator between them.  
    2. Easier to create unit tests.  


- [x] **Understanding App Resources**  
    Resources are used for anything from defining colors, images, layouts, menus, and string values. The value of this is that nothing is hardcoded. Everything is defined in these resource files and then can be referenced within your application's code.  

    |Name|Folder|Description|
    |----|------|-----------|
    |Propery Animations|animator|XML files that define propery animations|
    |Tween Animations|anim|XML files that define tween animations|
    |Drawables|drawable|Bitmap files or XML files that act as graphics|
    |Layout|layout|XML files that define a user interface layout|
    |Menu|menu|XML files that define menues or action bar items|
    |Values|values|XML files with values such as strings, integers and colors|


    |Name|File|Description|
    |----|------|-----------|
    |Colors|`res/values/colors.xml`|For color definitions such as text color|
    |Dimensions|`res/values/dimens.xml`|For dimension values such as padding|
    |Strings|`res/values/strings.xml`|For string values such as text or a title|
    |Styles|`res/values/styles.xml`|For style values|

    **Defining a String Resource**
    ```
    <resources>
        <string name="submit_label">Submit</string>
    </resources>
    ```

    **Referencing a String Resource**  
    From XMl:  
        `android:text="@string/submit_label"`

    Form Java Code:  
    ```java
    String submitText = getResources().getString(R.string.submit_label);  
    ```  
    
    **Defining Color Resources**
    ```
    <resources>
        <color name="white">#FFFFFF</color>
    </resources>
    ```
    **Referencing a Color Resource**  
    From XMl:  
    `android:textColor="@color/white"`

    Form Java Code:  
    ```java
        int color = getResources().getString(R.string.submit_label);        //deprecated

        int color = ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.white); 
    ```  

    >It is important to note that the most current way of accessing color resources (since API 24) requires providing context in order to resolve any custom theme attributes.  

    **Defining Dimension Resources**  
    ```
    <resources>
    <dimen name="textview_height">25dp</dimen>
    <dimen name="font_size">16sp</dimen>
    </resources>
    ```  
    **Referencing a Color Resource**  
    From XMl:  
    `android:textSize="@dimen/font_size"`

    Form Java Code:  
    ```java
        float fontSize = getResources().getDimension(R.dimen.font_size);
    ```  

    **Providing Alternate Resources**
    To specify configuration-specific alternatives for a set of resources, we create a new directory in res in the form of `resource`-`qualifiers`.  

    |Configuration|Examples|Description|
    |----|------|-----------|
    |Language|`en`, `fr`|Language code selected on the device|
    |Screen size|`sw480dp`, `sw600dp`|Minimum width of the screen's height or width|
    |Screen orientation|`port`, `land`|Screen is in portrait or landscape mode|
    |Screen density|`hdpi`, `xhdpi`|Screen density used for alternate images|
    |Platform version|`v7`, `v11`, `v21`|Platform version often used for styles|  

    >You can specify multiple qualifiers for a single set of resources, separated by dashes. For example, `drawable-en-sw600dp-land` applies to English tablets in landscape orientation.  

    **Determining Configuration at Runtime**  
    ```java
    String image;
    int orientation = getResources().getConfiguration().orientation;
    if (orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT) {
    image = "image_portrait.png";
    // ...
    } else if (orientation == Configuration.ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE) {
    image = "image_landscape.png";
    // ...
    }

    ```  

    >We can similarly access this within any object by getting access to a Context object: `getContext().getResources().getConfiguration()` to access the configurations.  

    **Alternate Layout Files**
    Often alternative resources are used to specify different layout files for phones and tablets. This can be done using the "smallest width" qualifier of sw.
